# Blog Writer

This skill transforms source content into SEO and AEO optimized blog posts. It supports five blog types, each with its own structure, word count, and CTA pattern.

## Step 1: Select Blog Type

Before generating any content, ask the user:

**What type of blog post do you need?**

| Type | Best For | Target Length |
|------|----------|---------------|
| Feature announcement | Release notes, changelog, new capability | 800 to 1,200 words |
| Product launch | New product, major release, rebrand | 1,200 to 1,800 words |
| Thought leadership | Opinion piece, industry POV, contrarian take | 1,500 to 2,500 words |
| Cookbook/tutorial | How-to guide, integration walkthrough, code example | 1,500 to 3,000 words |
| Report conversion | Whitepaper, case study, research report → blog | 1,000 to 1,500 words |
| News analysis | Breaking news, vulnerability disclosure, industry incident → expert take | 1,000 to 1,800 words |

Wait for the user to select before proceeding.

---

## Authority Content Standard

Before gathering inputs, confirm the source content meets the Authority Content bar. Authority Content is what earns distribution on X, rankings on Google via LinkedIn Pulse, and citations from LLMs.

Authority Content must include at least one of:
- An original framework or model
- A contrarian take backed by data or direct experience
- A detailed breakdown of something the author actually built, tested, or measured
- A case study with specific numbers attached

It must not be:
- A repackaged "10 tips" listicle
- A summary of what everyone else is already saying
- Generic advice without a specific point of view

If the source content doesn't meet this bar, flag it: "This content reads as [generic/listicle/summary]. Authority Content needs a stronger point of view to earn algorithmic distribution and LLM citations. Can you share the original data, frameworks, or contrarian angle behind this?"

---

## Step 2: Gather Inputs

**Read from repo automatically:**

| File | What to extract |
|------|-----------------|
| `docs/inputs/product_brief.md` | Product name, capabilities, limitations (for accuracy) |
| `docs/inputs/messaging_positioning.md` | Positioning, value props, pain points |
| `docs/inputs/target_personas.md` | Audience context, technical level, job titles |

Read these files BEFORE asking for additional inputs.

**Then ask the user:**

1. **Source content** — Provide the source material:
   - File path (Markdown or PDF)
   - URL to fetch
   - Or paste the content directly

2. **Target keyword** — (Optional) What keyword should this post target? If not provided, suggest one based on the content.

3. **Internal link domain** — What domain should I pull internal links from? (e.g., `beyondidentity.com/blog` or `docs.example.com`)

4. **Disclosure needed?** — Does this post require a disclosure statement? (e.g., "Full disclosure: I work at [Company]")

5. **Distribution surfaces** — Which surfaces are you publishing to?
   - [ ] Website/blog only
   - [ ] Website + LinkedIn Pulse
   - [ ] Website + X article
   - [ ] All three (tri-publish)

   If tri-publish or platform variants selected, generate platform-specific versions in Step 4.

Wait for answers before proceeding.

---

## Step 3: Research and Context

Based on the blog type, perform targeted research:

**For all types:**
- Fetch 2 to 3 pages from the user's internal link domain to identify linking opportunities

**For news analysis:**
- WebSearch for the original source: the vulnerability disclosure, research paper, incident report, or news article
- Fetch the primary source in full (not just the headline)
- WebSearch for 2 to 3 additional takes or reactions from credible voices (security researchers, analysts, practitioners on X or LinkedIn)
- WebSearch for prior incidents, data points, or trends that contextualize why this news matters
- Check if your product brief addresses the problem space (for natural product tie-in, not forced)

**For thought leadership:**
- WebSearch for supporting evidence, recent statistics, or counterarguments
- Find reputable sources published within the last 2 to 3 years

**For cookbooks/tutorials:**
- WebSearch for current best practices, common pitfalls, related tools
- Verify any version numbers or API references are current

**For report conversions:**
- Read the full source document
- Identify the 3 to 5 most compelling findings to highlight

### News Analysis (1,000 to 1,800 words)

This blog type amplifies breaking security research, vulnerability disclosures, or industry incidents. You are the analyst, not the researcher. Your value-add is the technical breakdown, the pattern recognition across incidents, and the actionable guidance. Credit the original source prominently.

```markdown
# [Named Technique or Finding]: [What It Means for Your Audience]

**TLDR:** [2 to 3 sentences: what was discovered, by whom, and why your audience should care]

## The Discovery

[What was found and who found it. Credit the original researcher or team by name with a link to the primary source. Summarize the disclosure factually. Include dates, affected systems, and scope.]

> "[Key quote from the original researcher or advisory]" — [Source](URL)

## How It Works

[Technical breakdown of the attack, vulnerability, or finding. Explain the mechanism step by step as if the reader needs to assess whether they are affected. Use diagrams, code snippets, or configuration examples where they clarify the explanation. You are translating the research for practitioners, not restating the headline.]

```[language]
// Example showing the vulnerable pattern or attack mechanism
[code or config]
```

[VISUAL: Attack flow diagram or architecture showing the affected components]

## Who Is Affected

[Specific systems, configurations, or deployment patterns that are vulnerable. Help the reader assess their own exposure. Be precise: name the frameworks, versions, cloud services, or architecture patterns.]

| Affected | Not Affected |
|----------|-------------|
| [Specific system/config] | [Specific system/config] |
| [Specific system/config] | [Specific system/config] |

## The Pattern

[Connect this finding to 2 to 3 prior incidents, disclosures, or trends. This section is your original analytical contribution. Show the reader this is not a one-off but part of a structural problem in how the industry builds or deploys.]

| Date | Finding | Researcher/Source | Impact |
|------|---------|-------------------|--------|
| [Date] | [Prior finding 1] | [Who] | [What happened] |
| [Date] | [Prior finding 2] | [Who] | [What happened] |
| [Date] | [Current finding] | [Who] | [What happened] |

## What to Do About It

[Actionable remediation guidance. Be specific: configurations to change, tools to deploy, policies to implement. If your product addresses this problem, include it as one recommendation among several. Do not make the section a product pitch.]

### Immediate (this week)
- [Action 1 with specific steps]
- [Action 2 with specific steps]

### Strategic (this quarter)
- [Action 1]
- [Action 2]

## FAQ

### [Question about severity or scope]
[Direct answer first. Then context.]

### [Question about whether reader is affected]
[Help them assess with specific indicators.]

### [Question about remediation]
[Actionable steps.]

---

**[CTA: Subscribe for future analysis / Related technical resource / Product capability if directly relevant]**
```

**CTA pattern:** Newsletter or content subscription first. Product tie-in only when the finding maps directly to a capability. The reader came for the analysis, not a demo.

**Authority Content note:** News analysis meets the Authority Content bar when it adds context the original disclosure does not provide: a pattern across findings, a technical breakdown for a different audience than the original, or specific remediation guidance. Restating the news with a product pitch appended does not meet the bar.

---

### Report/Case Study Conversion (1,000 to 1,500 words)

```markdown
# [Key Finding]: [What We Learned from [Report/Study Name]]

**TLDR:** [The headline finding and its significance in 2 to 3 sentences]

## The Big Picture

[Context for the report. Why was this research conducted? What question did it answer?]

## Key Finding #1: [Finding Statement]

[Evidence from the report. Include specific numbers.]

[VISUAL: Chart or data visualization from the report]

> "[Compelling quote from the report]"

## Key Finding #2: [Finding Statement]

[Same structure]

## Key Finding #3: [Finding Statement]

[Same structure]

## What This Means for [Audience]

[Practical implications. What should readers do with this information?]

### Immediate Actions
- [Action 1]
- [Action 2]

### Strategic Considerations
- [Consideration 1]
- [Consideration 2]

## Methodology Note

[Brief description of how the research was conducted. Builds credibility.]

## FAQ

### [Question about methodology]
[Answer]

### [Question about applicability]
[Answer]

### [Question about accessing full report]
[Answer]

---

**[CTA: Download the full report / See how [Product] addresses these findings]**
```

**CTA pattern:** Gate the full content, offer product connection

---

## Platform Variants

If the user selected LinkedIn Pulse or X article variants, generate these after the main blog post.

---

### LinkedIn Pulse Variant

LinkedIn Pulse articles are indexed by Google (DR 98) and cited by LLMs at 4 to 5x the rate of a year ago. Optimize for search and LLM extractability.

**Differences from website version:**
- Add a `**LinkedIn SEO title:**` field (can differ from H1, max 100 chars, front-load keyword)
- Add a `**LinkedIn meta description:**` field (under 160 chars, keyword-rich)
- Add a `**LinkedIn CTA:**` at the end — drive comments, not clicks. Example: "What's your experience with [topic]? Drop it in the comments."
- Add an `**Author bio line:**` at the end: [Name], [Title] at [Company]. Verifiable professional identity improves LLM trust signals.

**LLM citation optimization for LinkedIn Pulse:**
- Keep paragraphs under 80 words (LLMs extract short, declarative statements)
- Use H2 sections with archetypal phrasing ("What is X", "How to Y", "X vs Y")
- Include at least one statistic with a cited source
- No invented brand terminology without context

Output format:

```
## LinkedIn Pulse Variant

**LinkedIn SEO title:** [keyword-front-loaded title, max 100 chars]
**LinkedIn meta description:** [under 160 chars, keyword-rich]

[Full article content — same body as website version, with LinkedIn CTA substituted]

**LinkedIn CTA:** [Comment-driving question or prompt]
**Author bio line:** [Name], [Title] at [Company]
```

---

### X Article Variant

X articles benefit from the algorithmic For You feed — 30 to 40% of views come from non-followers. Virality depends on strong engagement in the first 30 to 60 minutes.

**Differences from website version:**
- Sharper opening hook — first 2 sentences must create enough tension or surprise to stop a scroll
- More opinionated framing — if the article doesn't make at least some readers disagree, it won't generate quote reposts
- Add a `**Quote repost prompt:**` at the end — a 1-sentence take that's controversial or insight-dense enough to make someone want to add their own perspective
- X articles support up to 25K characters; no need to truncate

Output format:

```
## X Article Variant

[Full article content — same body with sharpened opening hook and more opinionated framing]

**Quote repost prompt:** [1-sentence take designed to provoke substantive reaction — not rage bait, but a real point of view people will want to respond to]
```

---

## SEO and AEO Requirements

Apply these to every blog post:

### Metadescription
- Under 160 characters
- Include target keyword naturally
- Convey the value proposition
- End with implicit or explicit CTA

### TLDR Section
- Place immediately after the title
- 2 to 4 sentences maximum
- Must stand alone as a complete summary
- This is what LLMs will extract for AI-generated answers

### FAQ Section
- 3 to 5 questions per post
- Phrase questions exactly as users would search them
- Start each answer with a direct response, then elaborate
- Use "What is", "How to", "Why does", "Can I" patterns

### Schema Markup Suggestions

| Blog Type | Recommended Schema |
|-----------|-------------------|
| Feature announcement | Article + FAQPage |
| Product launch | Article + FAQPage + Product |
| Thought leadership | Article + FAQPage |
| Cookbook/tutorial | HowTo + FAQPage |
| News analysis | Article + FAQPage |
| Report conversion | Article + FAQPage |

Output schema suggestion at the end of the post:

```
**Schema markup:** [Type] schema recommended. Key properties: [list]
```

### Internal Linking
- 3 to 5 contextual links per 1,000 words
- Links must be relevant to the surrounding content
- Fetch pages from user's specified domain to find real URLs
- Format as: `[anchor text](URL)` with natural anchor text

Output internal linking recommendations:

```
**Internal links to add:**
- Link to [page title](URL) in the [section name] section
- Link to [page title](URL) when mentioning [topic]
```

### LinkedIn Pulse SEO

When publishing to LinkedIn Pulse, apply these in the publishing settings:
- Set a custom SEO title in LinkedIn's article settings (separate from the H1)
- Set a custom meta description (LinkedIn now exposes this in the publishing UI)
- The article URL inherits LinkedIn's /pulse/ slug with DR 98 — no additional domain authority needed

### Heading Structure
- Use archetypal phrasing in H2s: "What is X", "How to Y", "Why Z matters"
- One H1 only (the title)
- Logical hierarchy: H2 for sections, H3 for subsections
- Front-load keywords in headings when natural

---

## Visual Callout Format

Flag visual opportunities with this format:

```
[VISUAL: Brief description of what's needed]
```

Examples:
- `[VISUAL: Screenshot of the dashboard with the new feature highlighted]`
- `[VISUAL: Architecture diagram showing data flow between components]`
- `[VISUAL: Comparison table of old approach vs new approach]`
- `[VISUAL: Code editor showing the completed implementation]`

---

## Writing Rules

- No passive voice
- Write for 5th grade comprehension (technical terms are fine when accurate)

### Formatting
- Maximum 3 dashes per piece (rewrite sentences that need more)
- Oxford comma always
- One idea per paragraph
- Short paragraphs (under 80 words)

- Use bullet lists for 3+ items

### Banned Words
Never use: delve, landscape, robust, pivotal, seamless, leverage, transformative, game-changer, revolutionary, cutting-edge, integral, nuanced, foster, glean, underscore, propel, unparalleled, vast, plethora

### Claims and Evidence
- Every claim must be backed by example, data, or citation
- Hyperlink sources directly in the text
- Sources must be reputable and published within last 2 to 3 years
- Never fabricate quotes, statistics, or customer names
- Product claims must match `product_brief.md` exactly

### Code Snippets
